# Assignment1

# Python 3.10.7

# start the program by running the file main.py

# the files are:
### main.py
### task1.py
### task2.py
### task3.py
### task4.py

### main.py has three function to test:
 #### 1- quadratic equation solver (takes three parameters a,b,c.  a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0)
 #### 2- pascal triangle printer (takes the number of rows to be printed )
 #### 3- simple function that sleeps for n seconds (take the number of seconds to sleep)
 
### you could decorate the test functions using decorators imported from : task1.py ,task2.py, task3.py, task4.py 
 #### 1- decorator from task1.py will calculate the execution time and the number of calls for the decorated function
 #### 2- decorator from task2.py in adition to functionality from task1 will also dump original source code of the function
 #### 3- Implement the decorator behavior in tasks 1 & 2 using a class decorator in addition to ranking function by execution time
 #### 4- if a decorated function encounters an error it pipe the error stream into a log file together with a timestamp.
